# ROD & ROCKS

Rod & Rocks is a new social media application for people who loves fishing. This app allows you to share and keep your secret fishing spots and your best captures. When you run the application for the first time you will need to create an account, after this you will be able to start sharing your fishing experience with other users.

## Getting Started

To create an account you need to enter to the Sign Up. For that, you only need to click in the button that says "SignUp". After clicking, the application will show a register panel. The application needs some info about you to be able to create an account. You will need to enter a username, a password and a email. Your data will be stored and you will receive an account. 

Your password is the key of your account, this password is personal, try to enter a strong password to be sure that anybody can steal it easily. In that sense, your password will be hashed also, so you will have a certain security amount. While you are creating the account you will also be able to see what password you are writing, this is a good way to ensure if the password you have write is the one you want and that you don't have commited any mistake writing.

Once you have checked and entered all your data click in the "SignUp" button again and the account will be created, if the registration was correct the app will guide you automatically to the beginning. Now you only need to enter your username and password in the Log In and you will be ready to start using the application.

## Create Spots and Trophies

If you want to create a fishing spot you will need to click the "Create a Fishing Zone" button in the main menu. Once you click the button you will be sent to the creation panel. Inside this panel you will be able to create your own fishing spot.

This is a good way to store your favorite and best spots, here your spots will be stored and shared to other users. 

To create your spot you will need to enter the neccesary data, first you need to name your spot, then you have to enter the name of the town or city where the spot is located, the next step will be to specify the type of water of the spot (you need to choose between Fluvial or Maritime) and to finish you will need to enter a description of the sport, here you can add relevant info or  small details that you want to share about your spot. 

Once you have entered all data just click the "Add Zone" button, if everything is okay a toast will be shown telling you that the spot has been create correctly. If you want to go back to the main menu you will have to click the "Back to Home" button.

You can also store and create your best fishing captures. If you want to do it you will need to click in the "Create a Fishing Trophy" button in the main menu. Clicking here you will be sent to the creation panel again, but this time you will be able to create a trophy instead of a spot. The process is the same, here you will also need to name your capture, set the location where the capture took place and a description of the capture, but you will need also to enter the size or weight of the fish you caught. Once everything is set click the "Add Trophy" button and your trophy will be created. Press "Back" and you will be sent to the main menu.

## Searching for Spots and Trophies

Until now we have created fishing spots and trophies but we can also see them, your own ones and the ones that other users have created. If you want to take a look for this content you will need to enter from the main menu. If you want to see spots click in the "See Fishing Zones" button, otherwise if you want to search for trophies click in the "See fishing Trophies" button.

In both cases you will see a list of content, each item will show you the info about the respective spot or trophy. In both cases also the item will have a button attached, in the fishing spot case the button will show you the location of the town or city of ths spot in Google Maps, and in the case of trophies the button will give you the option to share the data of the trophy.
